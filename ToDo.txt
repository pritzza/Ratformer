
Todo:

window rescalablility maintains aspect ratio (16:9)

scale graphics and everything else (im thinking you would travel the same ammount of pixels in fullscreen than you
would in smaller resolutions, resulting in you moving, jumping, and falling disproportunatly faster in the game with 
smaller window sizes) with size of window.

graphics

sound: music, FX


Done:

Collision scaled with player's center coords

Game screen layout determined by coords:

start out at (0,0) or spawning screen, move one room right and generate (1,0), etc.

create system to generate new rooms

create classes for diffrent rooms layouts

create system to update and check what room you're in

floor collision

fix bug where cant respawn when killed under floor

spikes
